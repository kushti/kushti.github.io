          Smart money for the people, mineable from home.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Proof-of-work cryptocurrency with unique kind contracts in extended UTXO model made with monetary systems development support in mind, also supporting Sigma-protocols based cryptographic applications. A lot of decentralized and peer-to-peer financial applications already exists, such as decentralized exchanges, stablecoins, p2p auctions, bonds, financial games (HodlCoin, AuctionCoin), monetary systems (ChainCash), etc. Still no ASICS, so mine it with GPUs. 
          I have made like half of all the core development here.

            NXT was first pure proof-of-stake cryprocurrency, CoinMarketCap top-3 by capitalization back in June 2014. I made some new features there, and started doing tests.

    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      Before cryptocurrencies I worked as software developer since 2006 in different companies and the as a freelancer, in the fields of database management software, web applications, distributed data harvesting and processing. Graduated from Saint-Petersburg University of Information Technology, Mechanics and Optics (ITMO). Read a course in cryptography there twice, in 2018 and 2020.
      
      There were some cryptocurrency-related projects I made back in 2013 (before Nxt), such as one of the first CEX prices aggregators, backend for a Bitcoin wallet etc.
